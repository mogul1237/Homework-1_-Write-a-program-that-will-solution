Write a program that will:
1. Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer. The program will print out all prime numbers from 1 to that positibe integer.
2. Write a program that will print all the perfect numbers up to the number the user enters.
3. Write a program that asks the user to enter a range of years. Print out all leap years within that range.
4. Write a program that will print the inverse of whatever number the user enters.

The aim of this homework assignment is to write simple programs that will be a review of the old material from previous course. It consists of writing 4 simple programs.
1. A prime number is a number other than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and itself. (Example of prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, …). Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer. The program will print out all prime numbers from 1 to that positive integer. It is better if you write a separate function to check out if an integer is prime or not.
2. A perfect number is such a number where all of its proper divisors add up to the number itself. (Examples of perfect numbers: 6 is a perfect number. Proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3. 1 + 2 + 3=6. 28 is a perfect number. Proper divisors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14. 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28.) Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer. The program will print all perfect numbers from 1 to that positive integer. It is better if you write a separate function to check out perfectness of an integer.
3. Def: A year is a century year if it is divisible by 100. (Ex. 100, 200, 300,…)
Def: A year is non-century year if it is not a century year. (Ex. 1, 2, 3, 4, …)
Def: A year is a leap year if it is a non-century year that is divisible by 4, or a century year that is divisible by 400. Nothing else is a leap year.

Write a program that is going to ask the user for the range of years and print out all leap years in that range 5 to a line. It is better if you write a separate function to check if the given year is a leap year or not.

4. Write a program that will continuously ask the user for positive integers (until the user enters a negative integer at which the program will be terminated). Every time the user inputs a positive integer the program will print out this integer in reverse. Your program should have a function that accepts and integer and returns an integer in reverse. To convert the integer to its reverse, your program will call this function.
